{% trans %}<h3>Catalyzing the Growth of a Vibrant and Diversified Automotive and Transportation Technology Ecosystem in Ontario</h3><p>The Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) builds upon Ontario’s position as a world-leading automotive manufacturing and supply jurisdiction in addition to the large cluster of information and communication technology companies operating in the province. Ontario’s high-quality post-secondary institutions, first class talent, innovative small and medium sized enterprises and infrastructure to support entrepreneurship ensures that the province is uniquely-positioned to capture the economic opportunity of the connected and automated vehicle (C/AV) technology space and lead the global mobility evolution. Through resources such as research and development (R&D) funding, talent development, technology acceleration, business and technical supports, and demonstration grounds, AVIN provides a competitive advantage to Ontario-based C/AV companies – allowing Ontario to reinforce its position as a North American leader in transformative automotive technologies, as well as transportation and infrastructure systems.</p><p>This initiative capitalizes on the economic potential of C/AVs and is expected to help the province's transportation systems and infrastructure plan for and adapt to this emerging technology.</p><p>AVIN is comprised of four distinct programs and a Central Hub.</p>{% endtrans %}
