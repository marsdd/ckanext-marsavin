{% trans %}<p>The Government of Ontario’s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) is ensuring that Ontario remains a world-leading jurisdiction in the automotive and transportation sector. Ontario’s high-quality post-secondary institutions, first class talent, innovative small and medium sized enterprises and infrastructure to support entrepreneurship ensures that the province is uniquely-positioned to capture the economic opportunity of the connected and automated vehicle (C/AV) technology space and lead the global mobility evolution. Through resources such as research and development (R&D) partnership support, talent development, technology acceleration, business and technical supports, and technology and demonstration grounds, AVIN provides a competitive advantage to Ontario-based C/AV companies – allowing Ontario to reinforce its position as a North American leader in automotive technologies, as well as transportation and infrastructure systems. This initiative capitalizes on the economic potential of C/AVs and is supporting the province's transportation systems and infrastructure plan for, and adapt to, these emerging technologies. AVIN is comprised of five distinct programs and a Central Hub.</p>{% endtrans %}
